# TONContest
In order for the sending to work correctly, you must change the SwiftyTON in the TOP 3 file.swift in the static transfer function (starts with line 160) change in the arguments (line 179) the bouncable argument is set to false.
Note: the test network does not work in this version of SwiftyTON, so when executing this context, I tested everything on the main network.
