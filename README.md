# TONContest
In order to bring down my project, you need to install it via Download zip.
Due to problems with git, I decided to add the project to the repository as a zip archive. Therefore, unpack the TONApp-Swifty archive.zip and then work only with it.
Then change the SwiftyTON/TON3/TON3.swift file on line 179 bouncable to false so that sending coins works correctly. 
Then build the project via Command-R.

When creating this project, a lot of work was done and I feel very cool and pumped during development. Many thanks to the Ton Foundation team for such an awesome contest.
